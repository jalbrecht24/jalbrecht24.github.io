Below is a list of completed and on-going projects pertaining to my experience in the world of data.

# Completed

## Project 1 - Sentiment Analysis for Game of Thrones via Twitter

Back in 2019 before the final episodes aired, Game of Thrones was widely regarded as the greatest television series of all times. For one of my school projects I used Python to grab tweets about the show, sort them by character and general sentiment to gain a better understanding over which character was the most popular. I then analysed and visualized this data further using r to create a final presentation for my class.
